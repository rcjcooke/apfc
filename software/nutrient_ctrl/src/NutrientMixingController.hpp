// Measure Electrolyte Concentration
// Determine total system solution volume
// Calculate additional water volume based on total system volume and top up accordingly
// Calculate nutrient solution topup volume based on target nutrient solution concentration and top up accordingly
// Mix the solution regularly (to ensure even distribution of nutrients and heat as well as regular sterilisation of the solution)
